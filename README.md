# Preprocess-GenBank-Data
Before we use the data from Genbank, we preprocess the data to let us better make use of the data.

After downloading the files, you should follow these steps:
1. enter file "virus_sequence", use 7z or Winrar to decompress the zip file to get the data from Genbank.
2. enter file "code",there will be a .py named "same_accession_to_one_line.py". Run this program after decompressing "virus_sequence", and it will create a new file named "1line_result".
3. Or you can directly decompress the zip file in "1line_result", it will provide you the preprocessed data.
